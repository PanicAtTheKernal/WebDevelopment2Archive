# WebDevelopment2Archive

### Description:
**This is an archive of my assignment from my module, web development 2.** This project was developed during November/December 2021. The assignment task was to develop a libaray with user accounts and a reservation system. The project was made in Php using xampp to host the local Apache server <br> <br>

This website is a libaray system. A user can create an account and login. 
Once a user has signed in they can view their reversed books. The user has the ability unreserve their books. This will update the database and allowing for the another user to reserve it. On the same page there is a book reserve feature that allows for the user to search for a book by parital search or by category or by both. The user can then click the reserve link to reserve the book. This will update the database to prevent other users to reserve the book while it's reserved.
