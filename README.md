#### Description
**This is an archive of my assignment from web development 2** <br>
This website is a libaray system. A user can create an account and login. 
Once a user has signed in they can view their reversed books. If they wish they can unreserve their books. This will update the database and allowing for the another user to reserve it. On the same page there is a book reserve feature that allows for the user to search for a book by parital search or by category or by both.
If you wish to install it, there will be an Docker image provided.
